The main simulation can be found in the main.py file. It simulated the particles of Saturn's rings and has arrows to show their direction. 

The kineticenergy.py file has the code to plot a graph of kinetic energy against time. 

The momentum.py file has the code to plot a graph of total momentum againt time.

The unittesting.py file has the code to unit test the variables used in
